                <p>Warning!!! Knows KARATE...and at least three other Japanese words. A perpetual adolescent with agoraphobic
                    tendencies. Intrigued by coding and web development she taught herself a bit about it before seeking
                    a formal education and career in development. Now a Web development addict with a child like joy in making
                    cool code work. Lover of anime, Korean dramas, boardgames, dogs, and most of the time, her husband. Made
                    in the Philippines imported to the U.S.
                </p>
                <p>I am pretty shy person at first but once I get to know you and feel comfortable with you, you'll have a blast
                    being with me. I'm most often found hanging out at my house, but with the right incentive I can be lured
                    to a museum, restaurant, movie, or anime collectable store.
